# OptiSpace-Home-Services-App
OptiSpace is a web-based framework that demonstrates front-end design using HTML and CSS and interactivity with JavaScript. The project simulates a home services booking platform â€” where users can explore services, log in with secure authentication, and contact the provider through an integrated form.
